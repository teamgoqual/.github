## Introduction

<b>"We Create a User-Friendly Smart Home Experience for Everyone."</b>

Through our experience with various IoT products, we have recognized a notable enhancement in quality of life.

Nonetheless, it has been disappointing to see that the adoption of these products remains limited. 
Consumers are less concerned with the technical marvels behind these innovations and more interested in understanding the tangible benefits they bring to their daily lives. Unfortunately, there has been a lack of brands effectively communicating this value. 
We identified a gap in the market for affordable prices, high-quality products, seamless control through a unified app, compatibility with various AI speakers, and secure services.

'Hejhome' was established to address these needs, providing users with a more comfortable and secure everyday life.

GOQUAL is committed to the "popularization of IoT", and we see Hejhome as the starting point. 
Our aim is not only to advance IoT technology but also to influence lifestyle changes, offering new choices that enhance people's lives.

We are experiencing rapid growth, introducing the smart home lifestyle to over 10,000 new users per month. 
We believe there is significant potential for further expansion, and we are excited to embark on this journey alongside talented colleagues.

Striving for greater speed and higher achievements, we are Team GOQUAL.
